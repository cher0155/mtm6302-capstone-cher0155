1. Throughout the process of building my quiz prototype, I have mostly relied on bootstrap. That's where I got the heading text and buttons.
2. On the CSS file, I changed the colours of the buttons and the text, added padding on the purple part and the buttons and added flexbox to center my buttons.
3. I incoporated the href tags on the button so that all the HTML files are connected. Once you click on a button, it leads you to another page. That's what I want to do for the quiz website.
4. While building my prototype, I have a hard time changing the sizes of buttons. I wanted them to be smaller. I tried changing the width and it's making buttons go on the left side of the page and makes it look weird.
