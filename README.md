1. Throughout the process of building my quiz prototype, I have mostly relied on bootstrap. That's where I got the heading text and buttons.
2. On the CSS file, I changed the width and the colours of the buttons and the text, changed the colours of the hover of the buttons, added padding on the purple part to make it larger and added auto margin to make everything centered
3. I incoporated the href tags on the button so that all the HTML files are connected. Once you click on a button, it leads you to another page. That's what I want to do for the quiz website.
